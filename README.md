# wavinfo

The `wavinfo` package allows you to probe WAVE and [RF64/WAVE files][eburf64] 
and extract extended metadata. `wavinfo` has an emphasis on film, video and 
professional music production but can read many other kinds.

If you are trying to read a particular kind of metadata from a WAV file and
it is not supported, please submit an issue!


## Metadata Support

`wavinfo` reads:

* All defined [Broadcast-WAVE][bext] fields, including embedded program
  loudness, coding history and [SMPTE UMID][smpte_330m2011].
* [iXML][ixml] production recorder metadata, including project, scene, and 
  take tags, recorder notes and file family information.
  * iXML `STEINBERG` sound library attributes.
* All known [RIFF INFO][info-tags] metadata fields.
* [Audio Definition Model (ADM)][adm] track metadata and schema, including 
  channel, pack formats, 
  object, content and programme, including [Dolby Digital Plus][ebu3285s6]
  and Dolby Atmos `dbmd` metadata for re-renders and mixdowns.
* Wave embedded [cue markers][cues], cue marker labels, notes and timed ranges as used
  by Zoom, iZotope RX, etc.
* Wave embedded [sampler][smpl] and sample loop metadata.
* The [wav format][format] is also parsed, so you can access the basic sample rate 
  and channel count information.

## How To Use

The entry point for wavinfo is the WavInfoReader class.

```python
from wavinfo import WavInfoReader

path = '../tests/test_files/A101_1.WAV'

info = WavInfoReader(path)

adm_metadata = info.adm
ixml_metadata = info.ixml
```

The package also installs a shell command:

```sh
$ wavinfo test_files/A101_1.WAV
```

## Contributions!

Any new or different kind of metadata you find, or any 
new or different use of exising metadata you encounter, please submit
an Issue or Pull Request!
